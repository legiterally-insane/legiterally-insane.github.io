# legiterally-insane.github.io
This is a test for creating a github.io website!

Remember, this is just a template of advice, to show you how these sort of things work! This repository is written 
exclusively in HTML and CSS with no Javascript, to show you guys how these things should work! 
For now, you're seeing this after I have gone over how to create a new repository, thats good! once you've done the hard part
(A.K.A making your own github.io repository), you'll now plan how you want your website to look like, and can research
using documentation found online on what you can do for this page
